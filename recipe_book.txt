[[ Main Course ]]
***************************************************************************************

[ Fettuccine Alfredo ]

Serves: 2-3

Ingredients:
227g tub clotted cream
25g butter (about 2 tbsp)
1 tsp cornflour
100g parmesan, grated
freshly grated nutmeg
250g fresh fettuccine
snipped chives, to serve

Steps:
1. In a medium saucepan, stir the clotted cream, butter and cornflour over a low-ish heat and bring to a low simmer. Turn off the heat and keep warm.

2. Meanwhile, put the cheese and nutmeg in a small bowl and add a good grinding of black pepper, then stir everything together (don’t add any salt at this stage).

3. Put the pasta in another pan with 2 tsp salt, pour over some boiling water and cook following pack instructions (usually 3-4 mins). When cooked, scoop some of the cooking water into a heatproof jug or mug and drain the pasta, but not too thoroughly.

4. Add the pasta to the pan with the clotted cream mixture, then sprinkle over the cheese and gently fold everything together over a low heat using a rubber spatula. When combined, splash in 3 tbsp of the cooking water. At first, the pasta will look wet and sloppy: keep stirring until the water is absorbed and the sauce is glossy. Check the seasoning before transferring to heated bowls. Sprinkle over some chives or parsley, then serve immediately.

[ Beef Fillet ]

Serves: 6

Ingredients:
1.2kg prime beef fillet (in one piece, cut from the thick end)
Sea salt and black pepper
2tbsp olive oil
Few handfuls of wild rocket leaves
500g (about 6) ripe plum tomatoes
5tbsp ketchup (homemade is ideal)
2tbsp Worchestershire sauce
1tbsp Dijon mustard
Few dashes of Tabasco sauce
Juice of 1 lemon
2tbsp balsamic vinegar
2tbsp extra virgin olive oil
2 shallots, peeled and finely chopped
Large handful each of tarragon and flat leaf parsley, chopped

Steps:
1. To make the dressing, cut each tomato in half and squeeze out the seeds. Finely chop the flesh and place in a large bowl. Add the rest of the ingredients, except for the herbs, and mix well. Season well with salt and pepper to taste. Cover with cling film and chill for at least 20 mins or until ready to serve.

2. Heat the oven to 200°C/Gas 6 and preheat a roasting pan. Trim any fat or sinew from the fillet of beef and season all over with salt and pepper. Heat a non-stick frying pan with a little olive oil. When it is very hot, add the beef and sear for 1½-2 mins on each side until evenly browned all over.

3. Lightly oil the hot roasting pan. Transfer the beef to the roasting pan and place it in the oven. Roast for 25 mins for medium rare beef – it should feel a little springy when lightly pressed. Transfer the fillet to a warm platter and leave to rest for 10 mins.

4. Serve the beef warm or at room temperature. Slice it thickly and overlap the slices on a serving platter. Pile the rocket into the centre. Stir the chopped herbs into the tomato tarragon dressing and spoon over the beef. Accompany with new potatoes if you like.

[ Vegetarian Risotto]

Serves: 4

Ingredients:
45g butter
1 shallot, finely chopped
2 big garlic cloves, finely chopped
1 bay leaf
300g buckwheat
150ml white wine
15g dried porcini mushrooms soaked in 800ml water, drained, liquid reserved and mushrooms chopped
200g Portobello mushrooms, sliced
250g chestnut mushrooms, sliced
200g cooked beetroot, grated
100ml crème fraîche
1 tbsp creamed horseradish
½ small pack dill, leaves chopped, plus some fronds to serve
juice ½ lemon

Steps:
1. Mix all the ingredients for the buraczki together in a bowl with some seasoning, then set aside.

2. Melt 15g of the butter in a sauté pan over a medium heat. Add the shallot and a pinch of salt and cook for 8 mins until softened but not coloured, stirring occasionally. Stir in the garlic and bay leaf, cook for 1 min more, then tip in the buckwheat. Toast the grain for 1 min then pour in the wine. Once the wine has nearly reduced, add some of the mushroom liquor and stir until absorbed.

3. Continue to gradually add the liquor and stir occasionally until all the liquor has been used and the buckwheat is tender but with a slight bite. This will take 20 mins.

4. Meanwhile, heat the remaining butter in a frying pan over a high heat. Add the mushrooms and fry for 5 mins until all the liquid has evaporated and they are golden. Don’t worry if the butter goes brown – this adds a welcome nutty taste.

5. Add the mushrooms to the risotto, give it a good stir and season to taste. Serve in bowls topped with the buraczki and some dill fronds.

397g can condensed milk

Cocoa powder

2. Place 75g butter and sugar into a non-stick saucepan over a low heat, stirring all the time until the sugar has dissolved. Add the condensed milk and bring to a rapid boil for about a minute, stirring all the time for a thick golden caramel. Spread the caramel over the base, cool and then chill for about 1 hour, until firm or until ready to serve.

3. Carefully lift the pie from the tin and place on a serving plate. Slice the bananas; fold half of them into the softly whipped cream and spoon over the base. Decorate with the remaining bananas and finish with dusting cocoa powder on top.
   To get the most out of our banoffee pie recipe, make sure that you really boil the filling for at least 1 minute to be sure it sets to a fantastically tasty squidgy caramel. You can also use grated chocolate to decorate the pie!
