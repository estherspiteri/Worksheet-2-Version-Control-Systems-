[ Mushroom soup ]

serveS 6 people

10)1/2 cup (120 ml) heavy cream
11)1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper (more or less to taste)

steps:

Once the butter has melted, add the mushrooms, stir to coat with the olive oil and butter.Cook the mushrooms on medium high heat until they are lightly browned and have released most of their water, about 10 minutes.Remove 1 cup of the cooked mushrooms from the pot and set aside (they will be added back in later).
2) Add shallots, garlic: Reduce heat to medium. Add the minced shallots and the garlic to the pot, stir to combine, cook for about a minute.
3) Add salt, tarragon, stock: Add the salt, dried tarragon, and the stock to the pot. Increase the heat to medium high, bring to a simmer and cook, uncovered, for 10 minutes. Remove from heat. 
4) Purée soup: Using an immersion blender or working in batches with a standing blender, purée the soup until smooth.at to medium high, bring to a simmer and cook, uncovered, for 10 minutes. Remove from heat.Then return to the pot. (If the soup is too thick for you, add some water or more stock to thin the soup to the desired level of thickness.)

[Bruschetta]
serves 6-10 as an appetizer

ingredients:
1)6 or 7 ripe tomatoes (about 1 1/2 lbs)
2)2 cloves garlic, minced (about 2 teaspoons)
3)1 Tbsp extra virgin olive oil
4)1 teaspoon balsamic vinegar
5)6-8 fresh basil leaves, thinly sliced* or chopped
6)3/4 teaspoon sea salt, more or less to taste
7)1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, more or less to taste
8)1 baguette French bread or similar Italian bread
9)1/4 cup (60 ml) olive oil

steps:
1) Blanch and peel the tomatoes: Bring 2 quarts of water to a boil. As the water is heating make shallow cuts in a cross pattern at the tip ends of the tomatoes (this will make the tomatoes easier to peel).Once the water is boiling, remove the pot from the heat. Put the tomatoes in the hot water and blanch for 1 minute.Remove with a slotted spoon and let sit until cool enough to handle. Then gently peel off the tomato skins. Cut out the stem base with a paring knife.Cut the tomatoes into halves or quarters and squeeze out most of the juices and seeds.

2) Preheat oven to 450°F (230°C) with a rack in the top slot of the oven.

3) Chop tomatoes, toss them with garlic, olive oil, vinegar, basil, salt and pepper: Finely chop the tomatoes and place them in a medium bowl. Mix in the minced garlic, 1 Tbsp extra virgin olive oil, and the balsamic vinegar.Stir in the thinly sliced basil and add salt and freshly ground black pepper, adding more to taste. 

4)Toast the baguette slices: Use a bread knife to slice the baguette on the diagonal making half-inch thick slices. Brush one side of each slice with olive oil (a pastry brush helps here) and place olive oil-side down on a baking sheet or roasting pan.The baguette slices will toast best in the top rack of your oven, so you may need to work in batches to toast them all.When the oven has reached 450°F (230°C) place the slices in the oven on the top rack and toast for 5 to 6 minutes until lightly browned around the edges.

5)Serve toasted bread with tomato mixture: Arrange the toasted bread on a platter, olive oil side facing up (the olive oil will help create a temporary barrier keeping the bread from getting soggy from the chopped tomatoes).

[ Fettuccine Alfredo ]

Serves: 2-3

Ingredients:
227g tub clotted cream
25g butter (about 2 tbsp)
1 tsp cornflour
100g parmesan, grated
freshly grated nutmeg
250g fresh fettuccine
snipped chives, to serve

Steps:
1. In a medium saucepan, stir the clotted cream, butter and cornflour over a low-ish heat and bring to a low simmer. Turn off the heat and keep warm.

2. Meanwhile, put the cheese and nutmeg in a small bowl and add a good grinding of black pepper, then stir everything together (don’t add any salt at this stage).

3. Put the pasta in another pan with 2 tsp salt, pour over some boiling water and cook following pack instructions (usually 3-4 mins). When cooked, scoop some of the cooking water into a heatproof jug or mug and drain the pasta, but not too thoroughly.

4. Add the pasta to the pan with the clotted cream mixture, then sprinkle over the cheese and gently fold everything together over a low heat using a rubber spatula. When combined, splash in 3 tbsp of the cooking water. At first, the pasta will look wet and sloppy: keep stirring until the water is absorbed and the sauce is glossy. Check the seasoning before transferring to heated bowls. Sprinkle over some chives or parsley, then serve immediately.

5tbsp ketchup (homemade is ideal)

Few dashes of Tabasco sauce
Juice of 1 lemon
2tbsp balsamic vinegar
2tbsp extra virgin olive oil
2 shallots, peeled and finely chopped
Large handful each of tarragon and flat leaf parsley, chopped

Steps:
1. To make the dressing, cut each tomato in half and squeeze out the seeds. Finely chop the flesh and place in a large bowl. Add the rest of the ingredients, except for the herbs, and mix well. Season well with salt and pepper to taste. Cover with cling film and chill for at least 20 mins or until ready to serve.

2. Heat the oven to 200°C/Gas 6 and preheat a roasting pan. Trim any fat or sinew from the fillet of beef and season all over with salt and pepper. Heat a non-stick frying pan with a little olive oil. When it is very hot, add the beef and sear for 1½-2 mins on each side until evenly browned all over.

3. Lightly oil the hot roasting pan. Transfer the beef to the roasting pan and place it in the oven. Roast for 25 mins for medium rare beef – it should feel a little springy when lightly pressed. Transfer the fillet to a warm platter and leave to rest for 10 mins.

4. Serve the beef warm or at room temperature. Slice it thickly and overlap the slices on a serving platter. Pile the rocket into the centre. Stir the chopped herbs into the tomato tarragon dressing and spoon over the beef. Accompany with new potatoes if you like.
