[ Fettuccine Alfredo ]

Serves: 2-3

Ingredients:
227g tub clotted cream
25g butter (about 2 tbsp)
1 tsp cornflour
100g parmesan, grated
freshly grated nutmeg
250g fresh fettuccine
snipped chives, to serve

Steps:
1. In a medium saucepan, stir the clotted cream, butter and cornflour over a low-ish heat and bring to a low simmer. Turn off the heat and keep warm.

2. Meanwhile, put the cheese and nutmeg in a small bowl and add a good grinding of black pepper, then stir everything together (don’t add any salt at this stage).

3. Put the pasta in another pan with 2 tsp salt, pour over some boiling water and cook following pack instructions (usually 3-4 mins). When cooked, scoop some of the cooking water into a heatproof jug or mug and drain the pasta, but not too thoroughly.

4. Add the pasta to the pan with the clotted cream mixture, then sprinkle over the cheese and gently fold everything together over a low heat using a rubber spatula. When combined, splash in 3 tbsp of the cooking water. At first, the pasta will look wet and sloppy: keep stirring until the water is absorbed and the sauce is glossy. Check the seasoning before transferring to heated bowls. Sprinkle over some chives or parsley, then serve immediately.

[ Beef Fillet ]

Serves: 6

Ingredients:
1.2kg prime beef fillet (in one piece, cut from the thick end)
Sea salt and black pepper
2tbsp olive oil
Few handfuls of wild rocket leaves
500g (about 6) ripe plum tomatoes
5tbsp ketchup (homemade is ideal)
2tbsp Worchestershire sauce
1tbsp Dijon mustard
Few dashes of Tabasco sauce
Juice of 1 lemon
2tbsp balsamic vinegar
2tbsp extra virgin olive oil
2 shallots, peeled and finely chopped
Large handful each of tarragon and flat leaf parsley, chopped

Steps:
1. To make the dressing, cut each tomato in half and squeeze out the seeds. Finely chop the flesh and place in a large bowl. Add the rest of the ingredients, except for the herbs, and mix well. Season well with salt and pepper to taste. Cover with cling film and chill for at least 20 mins or until ready to serve.

2. Heat the oven to 200°C/Gas 6 and preheat a roasting pan. Trim any fat or sinew from the fillet of beef and season all over with salt and pepper. Heat a non-stick frying pan with a little olive oil. When it is very hot, add the beef and sear for 1½-2 mins on each side until evenly browned all over.

3. Lightly oil the hot roasting pan. Transfer the beef to the roasting pan and place it in the oven. Roast for 25 mins for medium rare beef – it should feel a little springy when lightly pressed. Transfer the fillet to a warm platter and leave to rest for 10 mins.

4. Serve the beef warm or at room temperature. Slice it thickly and overlap the slices on a serving platter. Pile the rocket into the centre. Stir the chopped herbs into the tomato tarragon dressing and spoon over the beef. Accompany with new potatoes if you like.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Serves: 2

Ingredients:
30g Ricottta
1 Eggplant
4g Basil
500g Pizza dough
200g Pizza Sauce
2 tbsp Flour
100g Mozarella

Steps:
1. Preheat oven to 450°F. Rinse eggplant, halve lengthwise, and cut crosswise into ¼-inch slices. Tear mozzarella into small pieces.

2. Heat 1½ tablespoons olive oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. When oil is shimmering, add eggplant in a single layer, working in batches if necessary. Season with ½ teaspoon kosher salt and pepper as desired. Sauté, flipping halfway through, until crisp on outside, about 8 minutes total. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain.

3. While eggplant sautés, sprinkle flour onto a clean dry surface. Using a rolling pin or the heels of your hands, roll and stretch pizza dough to about ¼-inch thickness. Rub 1 teaspoon olive oil on a parchment-lined baking sheet, then carefully add pizza dough.

4. Assemble Pizza
Spread marinara sauce over pizza, leaving a 1-inch border. Add eggplant in an even layer. Top with mozzarella, then dot over ricotta salata.

5. Transfer pizza to bottom rack of oven and bake until crust is crisp and light golden and cheese is bubbling, 15-20 minutes. Meanwhile, rinse basil and tear leaves into bite-size pieces, discarding stems.

6. Plate Pizza
Cut pizza into slices, garnish with basil, and dig in. Refrigerate any leftovers in an airtight container for up to 3 days.
