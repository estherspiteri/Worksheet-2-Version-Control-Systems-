[ Prawn cocktail ]

Serves: 4  

Ingredients:

olive oil 
1/2 a clove of garlic 
cayenne pepper 
8 unpeeled, large, raw tiger prawns 
1/4 of an iceberg lettuce 
1/4 of a cucumber 
2 ripe tomatoes 
1 sprig of fresh mint 
1 small punnet of salad cress 
50 g peeled little prawns 
100 g mixed white and brown crabmeat

2) Toss the prawns for 3 to 4 minutes, or till cooked through. Remove from the heat and set aside.

3) For the Marie rose sauce, combine the lemon juice with the remaining ingredients in a bowl and set aside. 

4) Shred the lettuce, dice the cucumber, thinly slice the tomato and pick the mint leaves, then layer in bowls or jars. Snip in most of the cress.

5) Add the peeled prawns, dollop with marie rose sauce and finish with crabmeat, shrimps (if using) and more cress. 

6) Add a pinch of cayenne pepper and hang a hot prawn or two off the side of the bowl or jar. Serve with lemon wedges for squeezing over.

[ Bruschetta ]

Serves: 6-10 

Ingredients:

7 ripe tomatoes (about 1 1/2 lbs)
2 cloves garlic, minced (about 2 teaspoons)
1 Tbsp extra virgin olive oil
1 teaspoon balsamic vinegar
6-8 fresh basil leaves, thinly sliced* or chopped
3/4 teaspoon sea salt, more or less to taste
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, more or less to taste
1 baguette French bread or similar Italian bread
1/4 cup (60 ml) olive oil

Steps:

1) Blanch and peel the tomatoes. Cut out the stem base with a paring knife. Cut the tomatoes into halves or quarters and squeeze out most of the juices and seeds.

3) Preheat oven to 450Â°F (230Â°C) with a rack in the top slot of the oven.

4) Chop tomatoes, toss them with garlic, olive oil, vinegar, basil, salt and pepper.

5) Use a bread knife to slice the baguette on the diagonal making half-inch thick slices. Brush one side of each slice with olive oil (a pastry brush helps here) and place olive oil-side       down on a baking sheet or roasting pan.The baguette slices will toast best in the top rack of your oven, so you may need to work in batches to toast them all. When the oven has reached      450Â°F (230Â°C) place the slices in the oven on the top rack and toast for 5 to 6 minutes until lightly browned around the edges.

5) Serve toasted bread with tomato mixture: Arrange the toasted bread on a platter, olive oil side facing up (the olive oil will help create a temporary barrier keeping the bread from          getting soggy from the chopped tomatoes).

[ Mushroom soup ]

Serves: 6 

Ingredients:

4 Tbsp olive oil
4 Tbsp butter
900 g cremini (or button) mushrooms, cleaned, roughly chopped or sliced 1/8-inch thick

Once the butter has melted, add the mushrooms, stir to   coat with the olive oil and butter.Cook the mushrooms on medium high heat until they are lightly browned and have released most of their water, about 10 minutes. Remove 1 cup of the     cooked mushrooms from the pot and set aside (they will be added back in later).

2) Add shallots, garlic: Reduce heat to medium. Add the minced shallots and the garlic to the pot, stir to combine, cook for about a minute.

3) Add salt, tarragon, stock: Add the salt, dried tarragon, and the stock to the pot. Increase the heat to medium high, bring to a simmer and cook, uncovered, for 10 minutes. Remove from       heat. 

4) PurÃ©e soup: Using an immersion blender or working in batches with a standing blender, purÃ©e the soup until smooth.at to medium high, bring to a simmer and cook, uncovered, for 10       minutes. Remove from heat.Then return to the pot. (If the soup is too thick for you, add some water or more stock to thin the soup to the desired level of thickness.)

5) Stir in cream and reserved mushrooms: Whisk the cream into the soup and add the black pepper. Adjust salt and pepper to taste. Stir in the reserved cooked mushrooms.

[ Broccoli & Potato Croquettes ]

Serves: 12

Ingredients:

400g floury potatoes
150g broccoli
medium egg yolk
40g mature cheddar grated
60g fresh breadcrumbs
20g plain flour
2 medium eggs beaten 
100g sesame seeds
4 tbsp olive oil
100g cream cheese
50g natural yogurt
1 tbsp chives, snipped
2 tbsp full-fat milk

Steps:

1) Put the potatoes in a medium saucepan and just cover with cold water. Bring to the boil and simmer for 14-16 mins until completely cooked through. Drain and mash well, then put back in    the saucepan over a low heat and cook for 1-2 mins, stirring constantly – this will remove excess moisture.

2) Meanwhile, bring a small saucepan of water to the boil, add the broccoli and simmer for 6-7 mins until tender. Drain really well and pat dry with kitchen paper (it’s important to do this    thoroughly as excess water will make the croquettes a little wet). Finely chop the broccoli, then add to the mashed potato with the egg yolk, cheese and breadcrumbs. Divide the mixture    into 12 equal balls and roll each one into a short sausage shape. Chill for 10 mins in the freezer.

3) Meanwhile, make the dip. Put the cream cheese, yogurt and chives in a bowl and stir to a soft consistency, adding the milk if needed.

4) Put the flour, beaten eggs and sesame seeds in three separate bowls. Roll the croquettes in the flour, dip in the beaten egg, then roll in the sesame seeds.

5) Heat the oil in a large, non-stick frying pan and fry the croquettes on a low-medium heat for 4-5 mins, turning frequently for an even, golden colour. Drain on kitchen paper and serve    with the cream cheese dip.

[ Fettuccine Alfredo ]

Serves: 2-3

Ingredients:

227g tub clotted cream
25g butter (about 2 tbsp)
1 tsp cornflour
100g parmesan, grated
freshly grated nutmeg
250g fresh fettuccine
snipped chives, to serve

Steps:

1) In a medium saucepan, stir the clotted cream, butter and cornflour over a low-ish heat and bring to a low simmer. Turn off the heat and keep warm.

2) Meanwhile, put the cheese and nutmeg in a small bowl and add a good grinding of black pepper, then stir everything together (donÂ’t add any salt at this stage).

3) Put the pasta in another pan with 2 tsp salt, pour over some boiling water and cook following pack instructions (usually 3-4 mins). When cooked, scoop some of the cooking water into a       heatproof jug or mug and drain the pasta, but not too thoroughly.

4) Add the pasta to the pan with the clotted cream mixture, then sprinkle over the cheese and gently fold everything together over a low heat using a rubber spatula. When combined, splash      in 3 tbsp of the cooking water. At first, the pasta will look wet and sloppy: keep stirring until the water is absorbed and the sauce is glossy. Check the seasoning before transferring      to heated bowls. Sprinkle over some chives or parsley, then serve immediately.

[ Beef Fillet ]

Serves: 6

Ingredients:

1.2kg prime beef fillet (in one piece, cut from the thick end)
sea salt and black pepper
2 tbsp olive oil
few handfuls of wild rocket leaves
500g (about 6) ripe plum tomatoes
5 tbsp ketchup (homemade is ideal)
2 tbsp Worchestershire sauce
1 tbsp Dijon mustard
few dashes of Tabasco sauce
juice of 1 lemon
2 tbsp balsamic vinegar
2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
2 shallots, peeled and finely chopped
large handful each of tarragon and flat leaf parsley, chopped

Steps:

1) To make the dressing, cut each tomato in half and squeeze out the seeds. Finely chop the flesh and place in a large bowl. Add the rest of the ingredients, except for the herbs, and mix      well. Season well with salt and pepper to taste. Cover with cling film and chill for at least 20 mins or until ready to serve.

2) Heat the oven to 200Â°C/Gas 6 and preheat a roasting pan. Trim any fat or sinew from the fillet of beef and season all over with salt and pepper. Heat a non-stick frying pan with a little    olive oil. When it is very hot, add the beef and sear for 1Â½-2 mins on each side until evenly browned all over.

3) Lightly oil the hot roasting pan. Transfer the beef to the roasting pan and place it in the oven. Roast for 25 mins for medium rare beef Â– it should feel a little springy when lightly       pressed. Transfer the fillet to a warm platter and leave to rest for 10 mins.

4) Serve the beef warm or at room temperature. Slice it thickly and overlap the slices on a serving platter. Pile the rocket into the centre. Stir the chopped herbs into the tomato tarragon    dressing and spoon over the beef. Accompany with new potatoes if you like.

[ Vegetarian Risotto ]

Serves: 4

Ingredients:

45g butter
1 shallot, finely chopped
2 big garlic cloves, finely chopped
1 bay leaf
300g buckwheat
150ml white wine
15g dried porcini mushrooms soaked in 800ml water, drained, liquid reserved and mushrooms chopped
200g Portobello mushrooms, sliced
250g chestnut mushrooms, sliced
200g cooked beetroot, grated
100ml crÃ¨me fraÃ®che
1 tbsp creamed horseradish
Â½ small pack dill, leaves chopped, plus some fronds to serve
juice Â½ lemon

Steps:

1) Mix all the ingredients for the buraczki together in a bowl with some seasoning, then set aside.

2) Melt 15g of the butter in a sautÃ© pan over a medium heat. Add the shallot and a pinch of salt and cook for 8 mins until softened but not coloured, stirring occasionally. Stir in the       garlic and bay leaf, cook for 1 min more, then tip in the buckwheat. Toast the grain for 1 min then pour in the wine. Once the wine has nearly reduced, add some of the mushroom liquor       and stir until absorbed.

3) Continue to gradually add the liquor and stir occasionally until all the liquor has been used and the buckwheat is tender but with a slight bite. This will take 20 mins.

4) Meanwhile, heat the remaining butter in a frying pan over a high heat. Add the mushrooms and fry for 5 mins until all the liquid has evaporated and they are golden. DonÂ’t worry if the    butter goes brown Â– this adds a welcome nutty taste.

5) Add the mushrooms to the risotto, give it a good stir and season to taste. Serve in bowls topped with the buraczki and some dill fronds.

[ Sweet Onion & Cauliflower Tart ]

Serves: 6-8

Ingredients:

glug light olive oil for frying
1 onion, sliced
1 tsp brown sugar
25g butter
1 small cauliflower, separated into florets
1 fresh bay leaf
250ml whole milk
150g wensleydale cheese, grated
50g pitted black olives, chopped
4 fresh thyme sprigs, leaves picked
3 medium eggs
100ml double cream
200g plain flour, plus extra to dust
4 fresh thyme sprigs, leaves picked and roughly chopped
100g cold butter, cubed
4 tbsp ice-cold water

Steps:

1) For the pastry, pulse together the flour, thyme, a pinch of salt and the chilled butter in a food processor to make large crumbs. Sprinkle over 3 tbsp cold water and pulse again to bring    the mix together to make a dough – use another tbsp water if it’s a bit dry. (Alternatively you can do this by hand in a mixing bowl – use your fingertips to rub in the butter, then use     a dinner knife to mix in the water.) Tip out onto a sheet of cling film, shape into a ball, then wrap the pastry in the cling film and flatten it with your palms to make a disc. Chill       the pastry in the fridge for 30 minutes.

2) Heat a glug of oil in a large frying pan and fry the onion over a low-medium heat for 20 minutes until softened and slightly caramelised. Add a pinch of salt and the sugar and cook for      another 5 minutes. Set aside. 3 Meanwhile, in another frying pan (with a lid), heat the butter and fry the cauliflower florets for 5 minutes, turning, until golden. Transfer half to a       plate and set aside, then add the bay leaf and milk to the pan and simmer with the lid on for 10 minutes or until tender. Scoop out the cauliflower (discard the bay) and whizz in a food     processor with just enough of the cooking liquid to make a purée (or do this in a bowl with a stick blender). Discard the remaining liquid. Pour the pureé into a large jug or bowl and       leave to cool.

3) Heat the oven to 200°C/180°C fan/gas 6. Roll out the chilled pastry on a lightly floured work surface to roughly the thickness of a £1 coin. Carefully use your rolling pin to lift the       pastry and unroll it over the tin. Line the base and sides of the tart tin with the pastry, pressing it into the edges and flutes. Trim any excess with a sharp knife, leaving a small        overhang. Prick the base a few times with a fork, line the case with foil, then fill with baking beans or uncooked rice. Chill for another 10 minutes.

4) Bake the tart case for 20 minutes, then remove the foil and baking beans/rice and return to the oven for 6-8 minutes until the pastry is golden and feels sandy to the touch. Take the        tart case out of the oven and turn the temperature down to 170°C/150°C fan/gas 3½.

5) Spoon the cooked onions over the base of the tart and scatter over half the grated cheese (see Know-how), the black olives, the reserved cauliflower florets and the thyme leaves. Beat       the eggs and cream into the cooled cauliflower purée, season with black pepper, then put the tart case on a baking sheet on an oven shelf and pour in the egg mixture. Scatter over the       remaining cheese and bake for 30 minutes until golden and the filling has set. Serve warm.

50g wild rocket
80g ricotta

Steps:

1) Heat the oven to 200°C/180°C fan/gas 6. Put the shallots, carrots, garlic, lemon zest and juice and the thyme in a roasting tin. Drizzle generously with oil, then drizzle with the honey    and toss to coat. Roast for 25-30 minutes until the carrots are sticky, golden and tender.

2) Meanwhile, warm the stock gently in a pan. Heat a glug of oil in a large deep saucepan and add the rice. Fry gently for a few minutes, then turn up the heat and add the wine. Bubble for    3-4 minutes to reduce, then gradually add the stock, a ladle at a time, stirring often, until the stock has been absorbed and the rice is tender (40-45 minutes).

3) Leave the rice and veg to cool for 15 minutes until just warm.

4) Meanwhile, make the dressing. Whisk the vinegar with the honey, then gradually whisk in the oil. Season.

5) To serve, toss the rice, roasted veg and salad dressing together. Season, then stir in the herbs and rocket. Arrange on a serving platter, dot with the ricotta and garnish with a few    herb leaves.

For the base:
100g butter, melted
225g light digestive biscuits, crushed

For the caramel:
75g butter
75g dark brown soft sugar
397g can condensed milk

For the top:
2 bananas
150ml whipping cream, lightly whipped
Cocoa powder

Steps:

1) Put the biscuit crumbs in your bowl, then tip in the melted butter and mix it all together. Spoon this into the base and press against the bottom and sides Â– this is the base of the    banoffee pie recipe. Chill it for ten minutes.

2) Place 75g butter and sugar into a non-stick saucepan over a low heat, stirring all the time until the sugar has dissolved. Add the condensed milk and bring to a rapid boil for about a    minute, stirring all the time for a thick golden caramel. Spread the caramel over the base, cool and then chill for about 1 hour, until firm or until ready to serve.

3) Carefully lift the pie from the tin and place on a serving plate. Slice the bananas; fold half of them into the softly whipped cream and spoon over the base. Decorate with the remaining    bananas and finish with dusting cocoa powder on top.

[ Lemon Cheesecake ]

Serves: 12

Ingredients:

200g biscuits
125g butter, melted
500g spreadable cream cheese, softened
1/2 cup caster sugar
2 tablespoon lemon zest, plus extra to serve
2 eggs
whipped cream, to serve

For the lemon curd:
2 tablespoons lemon zest
1/4 cup lemon juice
1/2 cup caster sugar
40g butter, chopped, softened
2 egg yolks, lightly whisked

Method:

1) Preheat oven to 180C or 160C fan. Grease a 20cm springform cake tin. Pulse biscuits in a food processor until finely chopped. Transfer to a bowl and add butter. Stir until combined.    Spoon biscuit mixture into prepared cake tin and press evenly on base and sides. Cool in the fridge for at least 30 mins.

2) In a medium-sized bowl, combine cream cheese, sugar and lemon zest with an electric mixer until smooth. Add eggs, 1 at a time, beating well after each addition, until combined. Pour      mixture into tin and place on a baking tray. Bake for 25-30 mins, or until just set in the centre. Turn off oven and leave cheesecake in the oven with the door ajar for a couple of hours    or until oven is completely cool. Chill in the fridge for 2 hrs.

3) For the lemon curd, combine lemon zest, juice, sugar, butter and eggs in a saucepan over low heat. Cook, stirring, for 5-10 mins, or until mixture thickens. Strain through a fine sieve    onto a dinner plate or flat tray (this helps the lemon curd cool more quickly).

4) Pour curd over cheesecake. Chill in the fridge until serving.

5) Serve cheesecake with whipped cream and lemon zest.

[ Baked Apple With Cinnamon Goat Cheese ]

Serves: 1

Ingredients:

1 tsp cinnamon sugar 
1 apple 
30g plain goat cheese (chèvre variety), slightly softened
37.5g raisins (golden or regular)
40g walnut pieces

Steps:

1) Heat oven to 350 degrees. 

2) Using a paring knife or an apple corer, carefully core the apple, leaving at least 1 1/2 inches of apple intact on the bottom. Cut around the top of the apple, so the hole is wider at    the top of the apple.

3) In a small bowl, combine goat cheese, raisins and cinnamon sugar trio. Fill the cavity of the apple with the goat cheese mixture, pushing it down just far enough so the mixture sits    right at the top.

4) In a small dish or ramekin (one that is deep enough so it props up the apple so it doesn’t collapse), place the apple and bake for 30 to 35 minutes, until goat cheese is starting to melt    and apple is getting soft.

5) Top with walnuts and a sprinkling of cinnamon sugar trio and bake for another 7 to 10 minutes, until apple is just about to collapse and walnuts are toasted, being careful not to over-   bake. Let cool 3 to 5 minutes. Serve warm.
