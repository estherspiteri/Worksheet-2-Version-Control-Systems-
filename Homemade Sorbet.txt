Ingredients:

227g raspberry
3 tbsp sugar syrup
lemon juice 

Steps :

Sugar Syrup:

1.Combine the sugar and water in a saucepan and heat until the sugar dissolves. Simmer for a further 15-20 minutes until you get a sugar syrup. Pour into a glass jar/bottle. Let it cool completely and for best results, chill in the fridge until you need it.

Fruit Sorbet:

1.Cut up whole fruits into ½ inch cubes (except raspberries - these can be frozen whole).
2.Lay out the fruits in a single layer on parchment paper lined baking trays (it's OK if the fruits touch).
3.Freeze the fruits completely and store them in freezer bags.
4.Roughly weigh out 8 oz of the frozen fruit and place it in a small food processor or ice crushing blender.
5.Pulse to crush the fruits into small pieces and add the simple syrup, a tablespoon at a time (while pulsing) to create a smooth sorbet-like paste. Please see notes.
6.Add a squeeze of lemon juice and run the blender for a few seconds to mix.
7.Spoon it into a bowl and serve immediately - or store in the freezer until you’re ready.
