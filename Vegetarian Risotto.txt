Serves: 4

Ingredients:
45g butter
1 shallot, finely chopped
2 big garlic cloves, finely chopped
1 bay leaf
300g buckwheat
150ml white wine
15g dried porcini mushrooms soaked in 800ml water, drained, liquid reserved and mushrooms chopped
200g Portobello mushrooms, sliced
250g chestnut mushrooms, sliced
200g cooked beetroot, grated
100ml crème fraîche
1 tbsp creamed horseradish
½ small pack dill, leaves chopped, plus some fronds to serve
juice ½ lemon

Steps:
1. Mix all the ingredients for the buraczki together in a bowl with some seasoning, then set aside.

2. Melt 15g of the butter in a sauté pan over a medium heat. Add the shallot and a pinch of salt and cook for 8 mins until softened but not coloured, stirring occasionally. Stir in the garlic and bay leaf, cook for 1 min more, then tip in the buckwheat. Toast the grain for 1 min then pour in the wine. Once the wine has nearly reduced, add some of the mushroom liquor and stir until absorbed.

3. Continue to gradually add the liquor and stir occasionally until all the liquor has been used and the buckwheat is tender but with a slight bite. This will take 20 mins.

4. Meanwhile, heat the remaining butter in a frying pan over a high heat. Add the mushrooms and fry for 5 mins until all the liquid has evaporated and they are golden. Don’t worry if the butter goes brown – this adds a welcome nutty taste.

5. Add the mushrooms to the risotto, give it a good stir and season to taste. Serve in bowls topped with the buraczki and some dill fronds.
