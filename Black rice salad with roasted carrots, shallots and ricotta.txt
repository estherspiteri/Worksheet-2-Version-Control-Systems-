400g baby carrots
3 garlic cloves, peeled
Grated zest and juice 1 lemon
Fresh thyme
Olive oil for roasting and frying
2 tbsp honey

4. Meanwhile, make the dressing. Whisk the vinegar with the honey, then gradually whisk in the oil. Season.
5. To serve, toss the rice, roasted veg and salad dressing together. Season, then stir in the herbs and rocket. Arrange on a serving platter, dot with the ricotta and garnish with a few herb leaves.
