1. To make the marinated cherries, heat the sugar and water together in a pan over a low heat. When the sugar has completely dissolved, pour in the alcohol and bring to the boil 

2. Pour the hot liquid over the cherries then leave to cool to room temperature. Place in an airtight container in the fridge and leave to infuse overnight 
200g of cherries, stones removed 
3. Meanwhile, make a pickling syrup for the watermelon skin. Place the vinegar, sugar, spices and orange zest in a pan and bring to the boil over a medium heat. Remove from the heat and leave to cool 

4.Add the slices of watermelon skin to a separate pan and cover with cold water. Place over a medium heat and bring to the boil 
200g of watermelon, skin and rind only, sliced into strips 

5. Simmer the skin for 10 minutes, then drain and transfer to the pan of cooled pickling syrup. Cover and leave to pickle overnight 
6. On the day of serving, make the pasta dough. Add the flour to a large bowl and make a well in the centre. Add the whole egg and yolks and start to mix into the flour 

7.Bring the dough together with your hands, transfer to a clean work surface and knead briefly. Add the cherry purée and knead again to create a smooth, evenly coloured dough. Wrap tightly in cling film and rest in the fridge for 1 hour 
 
8. While the pasta is resting, make the hibiscus sauce. Add the water to a small pan and bring to the boil over a medium heat. Remove from the heat and add the hibiscus flowers 
9.Leave to infuse for 10 minutes, then pass the liquid through a fine sieve into a clean pan. Decant 2 tablespoons of the liquid into a small bowl and stir in the kuzu to dissolve 
 
10. Place the pan of hibiscus water back over a medium heat and bring to the boil. Add the dissolved kuzu gradually until fully combined, then keep warm until ready to serve 
11. Pass the rested pasta dough through a pasta machine, gradually decreasing the thickness setting each time until the pasta reaches a 2mm thickness. Use a blade attachment (or cut by hand) to cut the pasta into strips of tagliolini (slightly thinner than tagliatelle) 
12. Bring a large pan of water to the boil and blanch the pasta for 2 minutes then drain. Drain the pickled watermelon skin and mix through the cooked pasta along with the seaweed

13. Drain the marinated cherries and chop into small pieces. Divide these between serving bowls and twirl a nest of the pasta on top
