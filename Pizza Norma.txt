Serves: 2

Ingredients:
30g Ricottta
1 Eggplant
4g Basil
500g Pizza dough
200g Pizza Sauce
2 tbsp Flour
100g Mozarella

Steps:
1. Preheat oven to 450°F. Rinse eggplant, halve lengthwise, and cut crosswise into ¼-inch slices. Tear mozzarella into small pieces.

2. Heat 1½ tablespoons olive oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. When oil is shimmering, add eggplant in a single layer, working in batches if necessary. Season with ½ teaspoon kosher salt and pepper as desired. Sauté, flipping halfway through, until crisp on outside, about 8 minutes total. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain.

3. While eggplant sautés, sprinkle flour onto a clean dry surface. Using a rolling pin or the heels of your hands, roll and stretch pizza dough to about ¼-inch thickness. Rub 1 teaspoon olive oil on a parchment-lined baking sheet, then carefully add pizza dough.

4. Assemble Pizza
Spread marinara sauce over pizza, leaving a 1-inch border. Add eggplant in an even layer. Top with mozzarella, then dot over ricotta salata.

5. Transfer pizza to bottom rack of oven and bake until crust is crisp and light golden and cheese is bubbling, 15-20 minutes. Meanwhile, rinse basil and tear leaves into bite-size pieces, discarding stems.

6. Plate Pizza
Cut pizza into slices, garnish with basil, and dig in. Refrigerate any leftovers in an airtight container for up to 3 days.
